  <h1>Unexpected Travels</h1>
  <h5>Where the destinations are unexpected, but the experience is awe-inspiring!</h5>
  <p>Unlike other travel agencies, we offer travel packages across time and space! Always wanted to watch Michelangelo sculpt the <em>David</em>?
  How about Leonardo da Vinci paint the <em>Mona Lisa</em>? Our <a href="/art">Famous People</a> package will take you there!

  <p>What about if you prefer nature? Insects and fish and dinosaurs galore! Our <a href="/nature">Nature Through the Ages</a> package sounds right
  up your alley! Drop by the Devonian to sail the seas and catch sight of some really odd fish! Fly over the forests of the Carboniferous and avoid
  large insects! Prowl through the forests of the Jurassic alongside dinosaurs and, possibly, humans' distant ancestors!

  <p>But wait! If you want something a little less Earth-centric, our <a href="/space">Shooting Star</a> package can take you off of our little blue
  marble and out into the depths of space! Stop by Olympus Mons on Mars! Marvel at Jupiter's Red Spot and Saturn's rings! Find the <em>Voyager</em>
  probes and race them out past the solar system!

  <p>And if none of these packages interests you, drop us a line through the form on <a href="/contact">this page</a> and maybe next time you check in,
  we'll have something for you!
